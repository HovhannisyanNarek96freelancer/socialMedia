# ShareMe Social Media Application
https://sharemejsm.netlify.app/

Using React, Tailwind, and CSS, I developed a custom front-end social media application that provided users with an easy-to-use and visually appealing platform to connect and share content.

For the server side, I set up a Sanity Studio, which allowed the client to easily add, update, and manage their social media application data, including user information, posts, images, and links. I ensured that the server was secure, scalable, and easily integratable with the front-end social media application.

To provide secure and easy-to-use authentication, I integrated Google authentication into the application, allowing users to log in and connect their accounts seamlessly.
